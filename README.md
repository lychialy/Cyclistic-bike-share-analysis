# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis and Marketing Strategy

This is my project on the Cyclistic bike-share case study. This project analyzes the usage patterns of Cyclistic, the fictional bike-share service, focusing on data insights from the company.

It compares the behaviors of annual members and casual riders and provides insights into how Cyclistic can convert casual riders to annual members.

## Data
 The data used in this analysis is sourced from the Cyclistic bike-share service, cleaned, and analyzed using SQL in Google BigQuery. The dataset used includes trip data such as start and end times, start and end station names, user types(casual vs. member), and longitude and latitude data fro the stations. 
### Project Scope

-   **Data Analysis**: Using BigQuery, I analyzed Cyclistic's bike usage data to uncover patterns and trends between annual members and casual riders.
-   **Visualization**: I used Tableau to create interactive dashboards that visually represent key insights and findings.
  
Business Task: Analyze historical bike data to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike differently with the intention of designing marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.


There were three questions that I had to focus on:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Monthly Analysis

Visualized seasonal trends to show peak usage during spring to late summer, this suggests higher demand during warmer months. 

## Average Duration and Distance

Casual users have longer average ride duration compared to members. Indicating they may be using bikes for leisure or exploration. Both user types share an average of a little over 1 mile in distance per ride, suggesting similar travel distances.
