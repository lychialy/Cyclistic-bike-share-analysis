# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis and Marketing Strategy

This is my project on the Cyclistic bike-share case study. This project analyzes the usage patterns of Cyclistic, the fictional bike-share service, focusing on data insights from the company.

It compares the behaviors of annual members and casual riders and provides insights into how Cyclistic can convert casual riders to annual members.

## Data
 The data used in this analysis is sourced from the Cyclistic bike-share service, cleaned, and analyzed using Google BigQuery.
### Project Scope

-   **Data Analysis**: Using BigQuery, I analyzed Cyclistic's bike usage data to uncover patterns and trends between annual members and casual riders.
-   **Visualization**: I used Tableau to create interactive dashboards that visually represent key insights and findings.
  
Business Task: Analyze historical bike data to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike differently with the intention of designing marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

There were three questions that we had to focus on:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
